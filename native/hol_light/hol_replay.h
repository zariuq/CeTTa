/* hol_replay.h - checked replay of HOLR v1 streams, stream writing and
 * certificate export.  Format: docs/hol_light_stream.txt.
 *
 * A stream is a linear, chronological list of kernel instructions.  Replay
 * executes each one with the same kernel operations as the C API; no record
 * turns a stated sequent into a theorem.  EXPECT records only compare.
 *
 * Laws (tested in tests/hol_light/test_stream.c):
 *  - Atomic records: a record either commits all its outputs or none.
 *  - Resource failures (NOMEM, LIMIT, INTERRUPTED) leave the current record
 *    uncommitted and retryable; resuming retries that record only.
 *  - Logical refusal and malformed input are absorbing in strict mode.  In
 *    probe mode a refused record commits a FAILED placeholder for each of its
 *    outputs and replay continues; records using a FAILED id are DEPFAIL.
 *  - Budgets count records.  Any split of budgets, and any split of the
 *    input bytes across replay_feed calls, reaches the same committed
 *    history as one uninterrupted run; no committed record runs twice.
 *  - EMIT records are delivery occurrences: equal theorems emitted twice are
 *    delivered twice, in order, through a cursor.
 *  - A checkpoint is an in-memory clone of the replay (input, tables,
 *    cursor, environment).  Continuing two clones gives two branches; the
 *    kernel refuses to mix their objects. */
