"""The PeTTa or Prime spelling of a shared library source.

A shared library is written in base HE.  Its spelling for another dialect
is the same program with the HE-specific forms rewritten, and nothing else
changed.

Native results sealed by function/case (the PeTTa spelling):

  (function (case CALL (((return $v) (return $v)) ($r (return $r)))))
      -> (case CALL (((return $v) $v) ($r $r)))
  (function (case CALL (($r (return $r)))))
      -> CALL

  (function (case VALUE ((PATTERN (return BODY)))))
      -> (let PATTERN VALUE BODY)

A native answers (return VALUE); HE's function hands VALUE back untouched,
and PeTTa never evaluates a value twice, so the plain case is exact there.

HE's unify of two values is spelled as PeTTa's lib_he defines it, at the
call itself, so the spelling needs no import for it (PeTTa resolves a
nested import against the top-level program's directory, where lib_he is
not):

  (unify A B THEN ELSE) -> (if (= A B) THEN ELSE)

A spelling that still uses a name lib_he defines imports lib_he first.

Explicit interpretation of held syntax in the current space:

  (metta BODY %Undefined% &self) -> (eval BODY)
  (metta BODY %Undefined% (context-space)) -> (eval BODY)
  (metta BODY %Undefined% SPACE_VARIABLE) -> (evalc BODY SPACE_VARIABLE)

This is HE's full interpreter, not its one-step eval.  PeTTa's eval
activates the held body after its pattern bindings have been installed.
The zero-argument context-space instruction selects that same current
invocation context. An explicit space variable or named space uses evalc.
Computed space expressions and other expected types are not covered.

HE's one step of a call or a variable where the result is computed next
(a binding's value, a body, a branch, a scrutinee):

  (eval X) -> X

PeTTa computes X there once, from values it does not evaluate again; its
eval would compute X's elements too, and a list's elements are data.  An
eval in an argument stays: it is a computation handed over as it is.

A value handed to a native as it is:

  (: N (-> Atom ... Atom))
  (: F (-> ... Atom))
  (= (F ARGS...) (function (chain (eval (N ARGS...)) $r (return $r))))

HE computes F's arguments and hands them to the native N; N's declared
Atom parameters take them as they are, and the declared Atom results keep
HE from interpreting a result again.  PeTTa never evaluates a value again,
so its spelling is the call itself (petta: CALL).  Prime passes an
argument as a delayed computation, which case forces before the native
runs (prime: (function (case CALL (($r (return $r)))))).  In both, the
declarations of F and N are dropped: they state HE's contract, and in
these dialects an Atom type would keep an argument or a body from being
computed.

A datum handed to a native as written:

  (: F (-> ... Atom ... Atom))

An Atom parameter of F is the datum itself, unevaluated, and PeTTa and
Prime read an Atom parameter exactly as HE does.  The spelling therefore
keeps F's parameter types.  Only its result becomes %Undefined%: there an
Atom result would keep the body from running, and neither dialect
interprets the native's answer again.

A library that imports a generated realization names the HE one, relative
to its own file, as HE resolves imports; the PeTTa spelling names the
PeTTa realization from the top-level directory, as PeTTa resolves them:

  !(import! &self ../langdef/he/generated/NAME.metta)
      -> !(import! &self ../../langdef/petta/generated/NAME.metta)

Bare library identifiers in shared library sources declare standard-library
dependencies. PeTTa spells these explicitly as (library NAME); paths retain
their existing resolution and user programs are not rewritten by this tool.

The output file is generated: it carries no comments, and a gate compares
it with this transformation of its source.
