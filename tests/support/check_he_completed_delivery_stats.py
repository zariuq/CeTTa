"""A shared value is evaluated once per distinct node.  A DAG of depth n has
n + 1 distinct nodes and 2^(n+1) - 1 paths; evaluating it, typing it and
comparing it must cost the same at each further level, so every work counter
read here grows by the same amount from depth n to n + 1 as from n + 1 to
n + 2, with the machine on and off.  A typed DAG built by evaluation is made
of values HE already answered, so its parts are answered as they are and
its sources are published as their own values; no certificate is needed."""
