"""Drains of a space grow with the space, not with its square.

Usage: check_space_read_scaling.py CETTA_RUNTIME_STATS_BINARY

A drain takes one job at a time and records it done, as an MM2 rule set or a
work queue does: by transform (native and authored), and by a loop over
`once` of a match.  Each firing reads the first job, removes it and adds a
record.  At two sizes, each drain answers every job, and its work per firing
stays within a bound that does not depend on the size: the candidate rows
its reads offer, the rows contractions of removed rows move, and the rows
copied for readers pinned to the space when it changed.  A read that
prepared every candidate, a contraction per removal, or a reader copying the
space per removal, makes one of them grow with the space.
