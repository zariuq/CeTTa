/*
 * Versions of typed relations.
 *
 * A call of a typed relation runs its protocol: a guard per argument, the
 * body, a guard per result.  Each guard is a query of the relational type
 * relation; it filters, may bind the signature's private variables, and
 * multiplies answers by its number of derivations.  A trusted version runs
 * the relation's calls to itself without that protocol.  It is exact when
 * every skipped guard would succeed exactly once with an unread refinement:
 *
 *  - the declarations are functional (each symbol declared at most once,
 *    symbol subjects only, no authored get-type equation), so the relation
 *    has at most one answer in every mode;
 *  - entry facts, checked once where a checked protocol enters the
 *    relation, make each guard succeed and keep it succeeding: every fact
 *    holds of a ground argument, which keeps its accepted type under later
 *    bindings, and an uninterpreted argument (no symbol of it has a
 *    declaration, an equation or a builtin meaning) has a purely structural
 *    type, so the guard pair of a polymorphic parameter shared with the
 *    result accepts the argument exactly once.  An open argument would not
 *    do: another argument may share its variables, and the activation may
 *    bind them to interpreted terms (an open head bound to a declared
 *    constructor changes the argument's type);
 *  - the relation's equations preserve the entry facts at every call to
 *    themselves, return an instance of the polymorphic argument, and perform
 *    no mutation, so the facts stay valid while a trusted activation runs.
