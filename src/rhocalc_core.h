/* Sequential strict-core/Rhometta execution with an owned candidate cursor.

 * result arena, symbol environment, input's grounded resource owners and the
 * context's referenced runtime owners until close. Context copying grants no
 * new authority. The context's optional
 * payload_failure pointer is not retained: read the run-owned diagnostic below.
 * Synchronous-result correspondence requires an unchanged referenced world,
 * registry and library for the run. Opening does not snapshot these services
 * or replace the caller's current-authority/publication checks.
 *
 * Poll allowance counts driver transitions, including retained grammar and
 * initial normalization actions and canonical selector probes. Initial
 * normalization retains child traversal, flattening, process/name key bytes,
 * alpha lookup, stable sorting and wide expression assembly. Source/role
 * memo lookup, table clearing and collision rehashing retain their positions;
 * completed results share syntax storage without removing occurrences.
 * Hash-probe work depends on all prepared node addresses, including private
 * normalized nodes. Exact split accounts require the same prepared graph and
 * provider choices, not just equivalent original inputs. Memo subcounts expose
 * these physical actions without subtracting them from the actual invoice.
 * Component keys, endpoint merge sorting, channel-group scans, body-row
 * preparation, component merging and contextual reaction-key comparison also
 * retain their inner positions. A completed key carries its binder displacement;
 * quotation does not change its parent's counter. A comparison retains one
 * side's reply while the other is pending. Selected-body copying/remapping
 * completes before replacing the previous winner. Final canonical successor
 * construction retains its body copy, row merge and child assembly; only a
 * completed root becomes the next process. A normalized variable-free body
 * preserves its syntax sharing under literal substitution. Semantic substitution
 * retains scoped capture queries, alpha-renaming, normalized-name replies,
 * matched-only drop exposure, child assembly and the existing binding walker
 * for raw payload data. Each deferred result is classified before normalization;
 * definite nonprocess data is wrapped unchanged, while refused checking fails
 * the invocation. The actual normalized reply then determines substitution.
 * Deferred payloads still run and retain every result occurrence.
 * Compaction and export retain the existing graph-copy session; the old
 * generation remains live until compaction commits. Canonical export keeps
 * that copied graph; other orderings use the retained normalizer. Payload atom
 * rendering, scalar/name construction, allocation and cleanup retain atomic
 * services, including interning constructors, generation
 * retirement and control-owner destruction after a completed transfer.
 * The eager-copy opener retains its initial copy cost; the held
 * opener below avoids that copy with a stronger input-lifetime contract.
 * Payload transactions
 * retain setup/evaluation/promotion phases; an explicit provider can retain
 * evaluator and return traversal inside evaluation. Its own atomic services
 * remain separately priced, and the default evaluator is synchronous.
 * Driver counts are NOT a bound on their work or wall-clock cost; closing
 * also retains its separate cleanup cost.
 * Synchronous interning profiles keep their admitted atomic constructor;
 * incremental draft assembly requires a noninterning arena.
 * Rotating selection is one atomic frontier transition. Threaded runs continue
 * to use the existing synchronous/threaded entry points.
 *
 * Zero allowance is inert. No provisional result is exported. A result is
 * available only after DONE. Its atom storage outlives close in the result
 * arena; grounded references retain their existing ownership contract. Their
 * owners, including persistent_arena for escaping payload spaces/states, must
 * outlive all result use, not merely the run. Export does not acquire them.
 * Runs may be interleaved on one thread; each owns its error and payload status.
 * Concurrent use of a run, or moving it between evaluator threads, is invalid.
 * Advancement executes the payload handler. Closing retires owned cursor state;
 * it does not roll back effects already performed by that handler. */
