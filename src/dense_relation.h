/*
 * Conjunctions over dense binary relations, by bit operations.
 *
 * Each pattern is a binary relation of one space, (h a b): h a symbol, a and
 * b each a variable or an atom equal only to itself.  Its rows (h x y), x and
 * y such atoms, become a matrix of bits over one numbering of the atoms in
 * the columns the query reads, kept by rows in each direction a pattern is
 * read.  The variables are bound one at a time: a variable's candidates are
 * the AND of the rows its bound neighbours select, and the last variable's
 * are counted by popcount.  A consumer that reads only some variables, and
 * whose instances go into sets, has the others summed out by OR: each
 * distinct assignment of what it reads is visited once.
 *
 * A repeated row declines, so every row holds once, a solution is one
 * combination of rows, and the number of solutions is the size of the
 * answer bag.  A row holding a variable, or a value whose equality is not
 * its identity, declines too: the relational plan or the ordinary path
 * answers.
