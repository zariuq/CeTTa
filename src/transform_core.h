 * footprint validates, removes its takes and answers (tf:fired INSTANCES).
 * This realization proposes the same rows in the same order, directly over
 * the spaces' occurrence cursors and one trail-backed binding environment,
 * and stops at the first validating candidate when no `let` conjunct can run
 * code.  It validates the footprint by the multiplicity each taken atom
 * needs, and removes the takes through the caller's remove-atom and add-atom in the
 * library's order, so the store it leaves and its answer are the authored
 * firing's.
 *
 * It is admitted only while the live equations of every operation the
 * library defines, and the declarations of `transform`, are the library's
 * own; otherwise it declines and the authored definition runs.  A call whose
 * conjuncts it cannot read the library's way also declines. */
