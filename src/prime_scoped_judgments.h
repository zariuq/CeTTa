/* Draft scoped judgment bubbles beside the existing `type:` vocabulary.
 *
 * `set:`  — simple-typed judgments and proposition proofs over an admitted
 *           theory-space profile.  No selection leaves forms uninterpreted.
 *           HOL selects no set axioms; megalodon-hotg opts into them. Terms and types are the same authored
 *           syntax that `type:` accepts; every `set:` term judgment is the
 *           corresponding `type:` judgment in an environment extended by the
 *           signature, guarded by a syntactic descent check that the operands
 *           lie in the constant-family (simple) fragment.  `set:proves` checks
 *           a proof term against a proposition of type `prop` bidirectionally.
 * `lang:` — language-level operations: registered language inventory,
 *           parsing and printing of source text, and the diamond native type
 *           over Prime's own evaluation.
 * `try`   — one evaluation of a judgment with its outcome made explicit:
 *           `(Established e)`, `(Refuted r)`, `(Undetermined r)` or
 *           `(Incomplete r)`.  Nothing is stored and nothing is re-run: a
 *           plain judgment yields True, False or stays inert; `try` is the
 *           same single evaluation with the diagnostic returned instead.
 *
 * Ownership is by exact symbol: only these spellings are judgments.  Any
 * other `set:`- or `lang:`-prefixed symbol is ordinary vocabulary. */
